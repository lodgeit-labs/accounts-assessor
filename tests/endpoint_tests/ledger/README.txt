we ge a lot of these:

["unknown account by role: 'Financial_Investments'/'FinancialInvestments'/'SG_Issuer_SA'.\nPlease review the chart of accounts."]

there might be a problem where at some point, we expect the unit to be subcategorized through a unit categories sheet,
but there really is no such sheet in the input, and no subcategorization should happen.
