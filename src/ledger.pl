% The purpose of the following program is to derive the summary information of a ledger.
% That is, with the knowledge of all the transactions in a ledger, the following program
% will derive the balance sheets at given points in time, and the trial balance and
% movements over given periods of time.

% This program is part of a larger system for validating and correcting balance sheets.
% Hence the information derived by this program will ultimately be compared to values
% calculated by other means.
