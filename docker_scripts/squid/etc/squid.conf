# This default configuration only allows localhost requests because a more
# permissive Squid installation could introduce new attack vectors into the
# network by proxying external TCP connections to unprotected services.
http_access allow localhost

# The two deny rules below are unnecessary in this default configuration
# because they are followed by a "deny all" rule. However, they may become
# critically important when you start allowing external requests below them.

# Link local addresses for IPv4 in the range 169.254/16 are reserved for auto-assignment when the local host can´t reach the DHCP server. That´s different of the scope of IPv6 link local addresses, which are always assigned to local links and perform link local communication tasks within that segment.



#http_access deny to_linklocal
# This Squid introduces the to_linklocal ACL as pre-defined to match requests from 169.254.0.0/16 and fe80::/10. 
# this is already included below vvv
