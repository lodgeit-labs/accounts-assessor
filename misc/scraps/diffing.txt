/*
solution diffing:
(or anything diffing)
(after some experience with various xml and json differs, while working on endpoint_tests)
the result of a differ should be some human-readable descriptions of the differences. Declarations of these should direct the differ search like so:

result('are the same', X, X).

result('there are additional Items in X'(Items), X, Y) :-
	'X is Y with Items added'(X, Y, Items)

result('item in X is different'(N), X, Y) :-
	'X is Y with item N changed'(X, Y, N).

result('is a combination of'(R1, R2), X, Y) :-
	result(R1, X, X2),
	result(R2, X2, Y).

depth of 'result' recursion would be tracked, looking for minimal solution.


'X is Y with Items added'(X, Y, Items) :-
...

by extension, an explanation of differences between multiple solutions/items may be searched for, trying each solution against each other, trying to minimize the size of the explanation.
