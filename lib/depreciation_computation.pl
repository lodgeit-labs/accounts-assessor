/* There are 2 methods used for depreciation. a. Diminishing Value. What I believe you implemented. i.e. Rate 20% per period, 
Cost 100, then at end of period 1, Written Down Value is 100-20. For Period 2, 20%*80, For Period 3 20%*64 ... of course, 
written down value never gets to zero.

And there is Prime Cost Method. 20% of Cost each period. i.e. 100-20=80. 80-20=60, 60-20=40..... to zero.

And there is another concept to consider. If the asset (say a car) is depreciated to some value at some point in time, 
say $20. And the car is sold for $40, then there is a gain of $20. But if it is sold for $10, then there is a loss of $10. */
