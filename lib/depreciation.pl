/* Invest_in 1 Unit of Corolla, where Corolla is a Toyota & where Toyota is a Car & where a Car is a Motor Vehicle & 
where a Motor Vehicle is Property Plant & Equipment & Where Property Plant & Equipment is a Non Current Asset.

Now, assume some rate of depreciation that applies to Motor Vehicles. Say 25% per annum diminishing value. 

Requirement -
Given some profitLoss & balanceSheet future date, compute the Written Down Value of the vehicle. i.e.
Cost $100
Year 1 - $75
Year 2 - 75 * 0.27 = 20.25, 75 - 20.25 = 54.75

Provide queries that generate depreciation values between any two dates on a daily basis anywhere 
between the Invest_In date and the Written Down Value Date. */

% Predicates for asserting that the fields of given transactions have particular values
% duplicated from transactions.pl with the difference that transaction_date is used instead of transaction_day
% ok well transactions.pl transactions now use date too, just havent renamed it yet, so we can probably use it 
% The absolute day that the transaction happenned
% ok well transactions.pl uses dates, not days
% input and output xml should use dates too, so idk, best to convert it to days just inside the computation functions and convert it back after

% Type hierarchy - i guess should be input as a table of pairs, and we dont have anything similar in concept elsewhere in the codebase,
i guess. account hierarchy is parsed from a xml tree and represented internally as a list of id,parent_id terms, but thats not useful here i guess,
except you can copy the account_ancestor_id, but thats an easy one

/*eventually depreciation should be integrated into ledger, but not now, so, it will be nice if the representation of transactions here will be equivalent to ledger's, but not critical. i dont really know how it will even integrate exactly. possibly in process_s_transaction by intercepting some action types and producing the depreciation transactions? possibly just checking that they already exist in the input? idk

/* 
ledger integration:
If the temporal cycle of the depreciation calculation is annual, then each depreciation event is: 
Debit Depreciation EXPENSE, 
Credit Accumulated Depreciation (ASSET Subaccount)

So the Asset COST never changes, just the Credits associated with the Accumulated depreciation gets bigger. 
The net effect is that the Net Written Down Value of the asset gets less as time goes by.

Asset Cost less Asset Accumulated Depreciation.

At disposal, the Asset Cost Account is Credited & the Asset less Accumulated depreciation account is debited 
(with the accumulated depreciation) at date of disposal.

Such that both accounts must go to zero.

The difference goes to a profitLoss account along with the proceeds.

If the proceeds is greater than Written Down Value, then there is a profit.

If less, there is a loss. */
