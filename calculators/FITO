##inputs:

total assesable income
   foreign-taxed income (the income that the foreign income tax was paid on, that counts towards foreign income tax offset)
total allowable deductions
foreign income tax paid

# step 2(a) amount
ignored income = sum:
	foreign-taxed income
	any other income or gains from a non-Australian source

# step 2(b) amount
ignored deductions = sum:
	debt deductions attributable to your overseas permanent establishment
	deductions (other than debt deductions) that are reasonably related to ignored income
	an amount of the foreign loss component of one or more tax losses deducted in the income year.

##calculations:

taxable income = total assessable income - total allowable deductions
theoretic income = total assessable income - ignored income
theoretic deductions = total deductions - ignored deductions
theoretic taxable income = theoretic income - theoretic deductions
income tax = income tax calculated on total income
theoretic tax = income tax calculated on theoretic income
offset limit = max($1000, income tax - theoretic tax)
FITO = min(offset limit, foreign income tax paid)
