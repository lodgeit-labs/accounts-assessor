3 options how to handle data, in the context of current or pyco-ized prolog code:
    prolog terms, normally as it's now
        dataflow proof is generated in a metainterpreter, 
        or just in surrounding code,
        or not at all
    referenced from an l:value
        dataflow proofs are generated by the predicates that handle this form
        values:
            prolog terms
            triples





abbreviated identifiers:
	a - aspects
	c - concept
	

one formula might be:
	a([c - investments]) + a([c - investments])
