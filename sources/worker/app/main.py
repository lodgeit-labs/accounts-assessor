"""

the worker consists of two parts:
	* work_loop
	* helper api
the debuggability here might suffer from the fact that the whole work is done in a background thread. But it should be easy to run work_loop in a separate process, there is no shared state, nothing, it's just that it seems convenient that the whole service is a single process.



helper api:
	called from swipl. frontend -> rabbitmq -> proxy -> work_loop -> swipl -> helper api
	called from frontend. frontend -> helper api



parallelization:
	there can only be one http server listening per a container
		a container is:
			 a fly machine
			 a docker swarm container
			 a docker stack container in non-host network mode
	each container is therefore one worker.
	in development, it's most convenient to run stack in host mode, so, with only one worker, but we still want to parallelize.
	in production, it may also make sense to amortize the overhead of container isolation on multiple parallel jobs.
	
	therefore:
	
	we parallelize the worker, but there are three separate concerns:
		
		unicorn worker processes
			worker_processes
			> https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/server-workers/
					
			affects:
				helper api
					helper api is moreover parallelized by fastapi thread pool and asyncio
		 				> FastAPI uses a threadpool of 40 threads internally to handle requests using non-async endpoints. 
						-> the helper api has to be thread safe
				
				work_loop
					one loop is started per worker process
						* runs swipl synchronously
						* runs arelle synchronously
		
	previously, we would simply spawn multiple "workers" containers, and each would run a single actor process, subsequently single swipl process.
