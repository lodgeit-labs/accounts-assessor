	<!-- The container for XBRL GL, accountingEntries, is not the root of an XBRL GL file - the root, as with all XBRL files, is xbrl. This means that a single XBRL GL file can store one or more virtual XBRL GL files, through one or more accountingEntries structures with data inside. The primary key to understanding an XBRL GL file is the entriesType. A single physical XBRL GL file can have multiple accountingEntries structures to represent both transactions and master files; the differences are signified by the appropriate entriesType enumerated values. -->

This instance will represent two journal entries, one representing a permanent book to tax difference and the next representing a timing difference. The entries may not be best practices entries, but we hope they help express the power of XBRL GL.

Many companies do not record book and tax entries simultaneously, but do a later series of adjustments for tax purposes. This example does not illustrate that situation, but XBRL GL does allow a wide variety of other tax related representations and circumstances. -->
