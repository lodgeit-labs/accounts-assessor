This directory contains a SWI Prolog server (prolog_server.pl) that:

accepts a endpoint_tests/loan/loan-request.xml and generates a endpoint_tests/loan/loan-response.xml
accepts a endpoint_tests/ledger/ledger-request.xml and generates a endpoint_tests/ledger/ledger-response.xml 
etc,
and also integrates the chat endpoints

Note that this code relies on Murisi's Prolog code.

To use the server download and install SWI Prolog available at:
